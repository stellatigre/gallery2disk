gallery2disk
============

These 2 scripts will, in tandem, find all galleries on a given page that lists them,
and then download them all.  Run 'find_galleries.js' first.

This is an example of a scraper built for a specific site, not a framework of any sort. 

The example website uses a cookie-based auth mechanism, which the script handles.
